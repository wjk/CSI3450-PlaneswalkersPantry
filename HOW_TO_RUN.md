# How to run Planeswalker's Pantry

1.  Install MySQL Community Server. This must be installed on the same host as the web application will be running from.
    Also install MySQL Workbench.
2.  Install .NET 6. Go to [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and download the .NET 6.0 SDK (not the .NET 7
    SDK, and not the hosting bundle or shared runtime).
3.  Open MySQL Workbench and connect as the root user. Copy and paste the contents of the following file into the script window:
    [`src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/CreateDatabase.sql`](src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/CreateDatabase.sql).
    Run the entire script.
4.  In MySQL Workbench, connect as the PlaneswalkersPantry user. (The password is `PlaneswalkersPantry123`.) 
5.  Copy and paste the contents of the following file into the script window: [`src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/SharedCards.sql`](src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts             /SharedCards.sql). Run the entire script.
6.  While still connected as the PlaneswalkersPantry user, copy and paste the contents of the following file into the script
    window: [`src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/DomainDMU.sql`](src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/DomainDMU.sql). Run the entire script.
7.  While still connected as the PlaneswalkersPantry user, copy and paste the contents of the following file into the script
    window: [`src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/sol4r1s deck.sql`](src/PlaneswalkersPantry/SqlScripts/sol4r1s_deck.sql). Run the entire script.
8.  Download the entire code repository and unzip it somewhere you know. 
9.  Open a terminal and `cd` into the `src/PlaneswalkersPantry` subdirectory. To begin running the program execute `dotnet run`. A Web browser window should
    appear containing the home page of the web application.
10. If nothing appears, go to localhost:7261/ or localhost:5279/ in your browser to see the webpage. If this also doesnâ€™t work possibly check the port number in the terminal       to see possible solutions.
